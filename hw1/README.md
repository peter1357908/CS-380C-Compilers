TODO:
- check if the `break` statement is properly accounted for
- make a dedicated (optimized) BaliSymbolTable (like the methodlabels)
- ensure that all method calls are valid at compile time (currently calls to undefined methods still pass compilation)
- furnish error messages more (add context to assertions)
- find a way to build automatically in CLI (currently building with the Java extension on VS Code)
- write a script to test automatically in CLI (`make`?)
